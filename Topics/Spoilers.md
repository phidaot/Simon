### Direct Answer

Generally, revealing a spoiler is **not** considered copyright infringement. While it may be a social faux pas, it typically does not meet the legal criteria for infringing on a copyright holder's exclusive rights. However, the context and method of revealing the spoiler are crucial, and there are legal gray areas to consider.

### Legal Reasoning

To understand why spoilers are generally not a copyright issue, we must first define copyright infringement. Copyright law grants creators of original works a set of exclusive rights, including the right to:

* Reproduce the work
* Distribute the work
* Publicly display or perform the work
* Create derivative works based on the original

For revealing a spoiler to be copyright infringement, it would need to violate one of these exclusive rights. This is where a fundamental principle of copyright law comes into play: the **idea-expression dichotomy**.

#### The Idea-Expression Dichotomy

Copyright protects the specific *expression* of an idea, not the idea itself. This is codified in Section 102(b) of the U.S. Copyright Act, which states that copyright protection does not extend to any "idea, procedure, process, system, method of operation, concept, principle, or discovery."

A spoiler is, in essence, the revelation of a plot point, a fact, or an idea from within a creative work. For example:

* **Idea (Not Protected):** A character discovers they are related to the villain.
* **Expression (Protected):** The specific dialogue, setting, and sequence of events the author uses to reveal this familial connection.

When you reveal a spoiler, you are typically conveying the unprotected idea, not copying the protected expression.

### The Fair Use Doctrine

Even in a scenario where revealing a spoiler could be argued as technically infringing (for instance, by quoting a substantial portion of dialogue), the doctrine of **fair use** would likely provide a strong defense. Fair use allows for the limited use of copyrighted material without permission for purposes such as criticism, commentary, news reporting, and scholarship.

Courts analyze four factors to determine if a use is "fair":

1.  **The purpose and character of the use:** Is it for commercial or non-profit educational purposes? Is it transformative? Spoilers are often revealed in the context of reviews and critiques, which are favored under fair use.
2.  **The nature of the copyrighted work:** Fictional and highly creative works receive more protection than factual ones.
3.  **The amount and substantiality of the portion used:** Revealing a plot point uses a very small, insubstantial portion of the entire work.
4.  **The effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work:** This is the most significant factor in this context.

### Potential Gray Areas

The fourth fair use factor—market harm—is where the primary legal ambiguity lies. An argument could be made that a spoiler diminishes the value of the work by reducing the enjoyment for potential consumers, thereby harming the market.

However, as established in the Supreme Court case ***Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc.***, the harm must be one of market *substitution*, not merely market harm that arises from criticism. A scathing review can harm a work's market, but that is not copyright infringement. For a spoiler to be considered infringing, it would have to act as a replacement for the original work, which is a very high bar to clear.

There have been instances where media companies have threatened legal action over spoilers. For example, AMC sent a cease-and-desist letter to a fan group, "The Spoiling Dead Fans," arguing that their predictions, if accurate, would constitute copyright infringement. However, these disputes are often settled out of court and tend to involve situations where the spoilers are obtained through illicit means, such as a leaked script, which can involve other legal issues like trade secret misappropriation or breach of contract (e.g., a non-disclosure agreement).

### Conclusion

In summary, while revealing a spoiler can certainly have social and ethical implications, it is highly unlikely to be considered copyright infringement under current U.S. law. The core tenets of copyright—specifically the idea-expression dichotomy and the fair use doctrine—provide substantial protection for those who wish to discuss, critique, or even spoil creative works.

The legal risk would increase significantly only if the spoiler was revealed by reproducing a substantial, expressive portion of the work (such as a leaked chapter of a book or a clip from a film) in a way that serves as a substitute for the original work.
