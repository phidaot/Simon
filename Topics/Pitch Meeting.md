### Regarding Ryan George's "Pitch Meeting" and Licensing: A Legal Perspective

As an attorney, my assessment is that it is highly improbable that Ryan George or Screen Rant secure licenses for the films featured in the "Pitch Meeting" series. Their legal standing almost certainly rests upon the robust doctrine of **fair use** as it applies to **parody and commentary** under United States copyright law.

#### The Core Legal Argument: Fair Use

The "Pitch Meeting" series functions as a comedic critique of popular films. Instead of seeking permission and paying licensing fees for each movie plot they dissect, they are operating within a well-established exception to copyright infringement. The legal basis for this is found in Section 107 of the Copyright Act, which permits the unlicensed use of copyrighted materials for purposes such as criticism and comment.

To determine if a specific use is "fair," courts employ a balancing test consisting of four primary factors:

1.  **The Purpose and Character of the Use:** This is the most critical factor in this case. The "Pitch Meeting" skits are highly **transformative**. They do not merely reproduce the movie's plot; they recontextualize it within a satirical framework. The purpose is not to supplant the original film but to offer a comedic critique of its narrative, dialogue, and potential plot holes. This transformative nature strongly favors a finding of fair use. While the videos are commercial, the Supreme Court has affirmed that a commercial purpose does not automatically negate a fair use defense, especially when the use is transformative.

2.  **The Nature of the Copyrighted Work:** Movies are undeniably creative works, which would typically weigh against a finding of fair use. However, when the purpose is criticism and commentary, this factor often carries less weight.

3.  **The Amount and Substantiality of the Portion Used:** While the skits discuss the entirety of a film's plot, they do not reproduce the film itself. No footage, and minimal, if any, direct dialogue from the original script is used. The plot is summarized and filtered through the comedic lens of the "screenwriter" and "producer" characters. For a parody to be effective, it must conjure up the original work, and therefore, referencing the entire plot is often necessary.

4.  **The Effect of the Use Upon the Potential Market for or Value of the Copyrighted Work:** This is another crucial factor that weighs heavily in favor of "Pitch Meeting." The series does not serve as a market substitute for the original films. An individual would not watch a "Pitch Meeting" episode *instead* of the actual movie. It is more likely that the skits have a negligible or even a positive impact on the market for the films they parody by generating renewed interest.

#### Landmark Legal Precedent: *Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc.*

The legal standing of parody was significantly clarified in the Supreme Court case *Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc.*, 510 U.S. 569 (1994). In this case, the Court unanimously found that 2 Live Crew's parody of Roy Orbison's "Oh, Pretty Woman" could be considered fair use. This decision established that:

* A commercial parody can still be a fair use.
* Parody is a form of artistic criticism and commentary that is protected by the First Amendment.
* The transformative nature of a work is a key consideration.

#### Potential Gray Areas

It is important to note that fair use is an affirmative defense, meaning it is raised after a copyright holder has claimed infringement. The determination of whether a particular use is fair is made on a case-by-case basis, and there are no absolute certainties. However, the consistent format and critical nature of the "Pitch Meeting" series place it on very solid legal ground. The likelihood of a successful copyright infringement suit against them for this content is, in my professional opinion, exceedingly low.

#### Conclusion

In summary, Ryan George's "Pitch Meeting" series almost certainly operates under the legal protection of fair use. The skits are a clear example of transformative parody and commentary, which is a recognized exception to copyright law. Therefore, it is highly unlikely that they obtain licenses for the movie plots they feature. To do so would be not only financially burdensome but also legally unnecessary.
